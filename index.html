      <h3>What is PHP Test Fixture?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>PHP Test Fixture</strong> is a simple, minimalistic and efficient PHP testing framework authored and maintained by none other than <a href="https://github.com/DonaldKellett" target="_blank">DonaldKellett</a>.  It is simple in the sense that <strong>PHP Test Fixture</strong> is very simple to operate - it does not require the command line like <span title="Won't be mentioning any brand names here ;)">some of the more popular PHP testing frameworks do</span>, you just have to execute the PHP file containing your test cases using a local server (e.g. MAMP) <strong>like you would any other PHP script</strong> and ta-da - you have a visual representation of the success of your test cases!
      </p>
      <p>
        It is minimalistic in the sense that at the time of writing, the entire test fixture only occupies <strong>156</strong> lines of PHP code (of course excluding the <code>&lt;?php  ?&gt;</code> script tags) which means that the code for the entire test fixture can be downloaded at the blink of an eye and its execution speed is as fast as a PHP testing framework can get.  Of course, there's the added benefit that being small means it would barely take any storage space in your computer/server!
      </p>
      <p>
        It is efficient in the sense that because of its tiny file size, your test cases can be executed in the blink of an eye which can save <i>you</i> a lot of time if you frequently test your code.
      </p>

      <h3>Why choose PHP Test Fixture over other (more well-known and popular) PHP testing frameworks easily accessible all over the Internet?</h3>

      <p>
        Here are a few <strong>major</strong> reasons why you should seriously consider using PHP Test Fixture as your PHP testing framework for your TDD (Test-Driven Development):
        <ol>
          <li>It is simple, minimalistic and efficient (as mentioned above)</li>
          <li>Operating it and conducting tests require <strong title="Compared to other more popular and well-known PHP testing frameworks which require you to know quite a bit about the Command Line :p">nothing other than simple PHP knowledge</strong> - as long as you know PHP, you are highly unlikely to run into any technical difficulties when using PHP Test Fixture</li>
          <li>Unlike some of the more popular and well-known PHP testing frameworks, PHP Test Fixture gives you very <strong>visual</strong> yet simple feedback regarding the success of your test cases - you can immediately know if your code has passed all the test cases at the blink of an eye as soon as the page is loaded</li>
          <li>The output produced by PHP Test Fixture is HTML-friendly which means you do not have to worry about wrapping the tests in <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags or <code>echo</code>ing line breaks as the test cases automatically do it for you <span class="fa fa-smile-o"></span></li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>What can PHP Test Fixture be used for?</h3>

      <p>
        As stated above, the entire purpose of the existence of <strong>PHP Test Fixture</strong> is to make the implementation of (everyday) <strong>Test-Driven Development</strong> easier, more convenient and accessible to PHP developers of <strong>all abilities</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, <strong>TDD</strong> is usually used within a company to test their own code to see if it works properly (say, for example, their company website or mobile application).  Individual developers may also use TDD as their preferred method of testing out their own code.  And, of course, the vast majority of PHP testing frameworks out there help you to achieve just that.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with <strong>PHP Test Fixture</strong>, you can go one step further - if you have the PHP skills to implement it, you can make good use of the return values of the test cases to <strong>test other people's code</strong>.  What would be the benefit of testing <strong>other people's code</strong>, you may ask.  The ability to test other people's code (made possible by <strong>PHP Test Fixture</strong>) enables you (or your company if you work for one) to use the familiar TDD techniques used by your company (or yourself) to assess the (coding) ability of potential developers that you wish to work by your side to complete a major coding project, for example.  While you can use services like <a href="http://qualified.strive.co" target="_blank">Strive Qualified</a> or <a href="http://www.codewars.com" target="_blank">Codewars</a> for just that (and by the way, they are really great, you really should try them out, especially <strong>Codewars</strong> since it is free), PHP may not be supported yet in some of these services (at least at the time of writing, <strong>10/05/16</strong>) and by using <strong>PHP Test Fixture</strong> to create your own tests for your potential candidates/co-workers, there is more flexibility as to what you can test and how you can do it (provided you have the coding skills required to implement it).

      <h3>Documentation</h3>

      <p>
        The Documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/DonaldKellett/PHP_Test_Fixture/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>I want to see an example of the PHP Test Fixture being used and how the output looks like.  Where can I find such an example?</h3>

      <p>
        When you download the <strong>PHP Test Fixture</strong>, it automatically comes with a Demo called <code>demo.php</code>.  The Demo PHP file includes <strong>numerous</strong> examples of how each assertion method should be used and its output for both passing and failing tests respectively.  The Demo file is best used when you put the source code of the Demo file and the HTML (visual) output side-by-side to understand what is going on.
      </p>

      <h3>I mean, the Demo file is good, but can I find an interactive example where the PHP Test Fixture is actually being used effectively?</h3>

      <p>
        Don't worry - I've got you covered.  The Interactive Demo is not yet <strong>online</strong> but you can find the source files <a href="https://github.com/DonaldKellett/PHP_Test_Fixture_Interactive_Demo" target="_blank">here</a>.
